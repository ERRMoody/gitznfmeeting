Developed by Bui Quang Minh, Nguyen Lam Tung, Olga Chernomor,
Heiko Schmidt, Dominik Schrempf, Michael Woodhams.

Host:    IT072283 (AVX2, FMA3, 15 GB RAM)
Command: iqtree -s znf648dnaali.fa -m GTR -bb 1000 -wbtl -bnni
Seed:    916409 (Using SPRNG - Scalable Parallel Random Number Generator)
Time:    Tue Aug 20 14:39:06 2019
Kernel:  AVX+FMA - 1 threads (8 CPU cores detected)

HINT: Use -nt option to specify number of threads because your CPU has 8 cores!
HINT: -nt AUTO will automatically determine the best number of threads to use.

Reading alignment file znf648dnaali.fa ... Fasta format detected
Alignment most likely contains DNA/RNA sequences
Alignment has 72 sequences with 13664 columns, 3254 distinct patterns
2452 parsimony-informative, 1669 singleton sites, 9543 constant sites
